In this research, we are predicting the winner of League of Legends (LoL) professional games in the League of Legends Pro Leauge (LPL).  There are 17 teams competing against each other in the league, resulting in a total number of 314 games during the summer split in 2020.
We take the team names, champions in each lane, summoner spells and runes as features, the result of the game (win/loss) as the target, and conduct supervised learning through several classifiers to obtain the predictions. After that, we compare how different preprocessing methods, different classifiers with different parameters affect the accuracy, precision, recall and standard deviation of the result. Finally, we analyze the reason for conducting the inaccurate results and list the potential improvements that can be made in the future.
